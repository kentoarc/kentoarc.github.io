### Thursday morning, the sun is shining. 

I know that yesterday I talked a bit about morning rituals and how everyone has a process that they themselves go through. Well I had an interesting thought, while I was eating an apple this morning. One, eating an apple after brushing ones teeth is not a great idea. The apple has a rather funky taste to it. Then again most of what a person tastes after brushing has a weird taste. Anyways, that was one of the thoughts. The second, was that a realized that a lot of people don't really sit back and enjoy the small moments in life.

I used to be the same way, always pushing forward, taking chances with out ever stopping to think the decision through all the way not even caring about the consequences. This was my thought process about most situations in my life, all the way up until about a year ago.

Many events have come to past in my short life so far. A lot of the memories have come to my attention this past year as I have been self-reflecting back on a lot of my decisions. One glaring issue that stands out to me. The best moments I once lived are the ones I absolutely forgot to take pictures of. I am going to start working on capturing those moments.

All of this started with an apple. From that first juicy crunch, a few of my more memorable moments came back and I had wished I had pictures to look back upon.

Most may not have a moment of self reflection while eating an apple early in the morning. However, just sitting back and taking everything in may lead down that road of self reflection to those small moments that have occurred in life.

What am I going to do with my reflections? I am going to take my apple and make sure to take more pictures of life as I travel around and experience what it offers me.

See you tomorrow.
