Happy Monday!

Hopefully you all had a wonderful weekend, filled with smiles and high spirits. I had a wonderful weekend and plan to continue with it this week. A few big highlights would have to be playing Until Dawn (horror game) and Cheryl flying in.

Let us speak for a moment about Until Dawn. It is a scary game. Like a really scary game. Fantastic story telling and at least travels away from most horror tropes. Some nice twists and turns, great character development, and the decisions all have a nice weight to them.

I however am a huge chicken with these types of games. So, I mostly watched, while someone else played. 

What, I can't help that I get scared easily. But regardless of that it was an experience. Will I play it again? Nope! But I commend those that do. For those that were unable to come out and watch the whole stream, I currently have it exporting to YouTube. After that happens I will make sure to edit it all nice and neat.

As for the rest of the weekend it was relatively relaxing. Bought tons of food so that I can do some awesome cooking this week, as well as made pudding. Butterscotch pudding is the best pudding and you can not tell me otherwise.

Something else on top of the weekend was starting the show Narco's on Netflix. Really cool premise so far and about two episodes in me can say that the show is holding my interest.

Now, onto my Monday. It is a normal one. Got the gym later, some gaming most likely as well as checking out a few apartments.

Keep up the good work everyone and the weekend will be here before we know it!
