Good morning and happy Monday! Wait that is not right...Happy Tuesday! Hopefully everyone had a great holiday weekend and used that time off to get some much needed relaxation in, or if you are like me, perused another hobby. Regardless I hope the time was spent doing some sort of activity that you enjoy.

I figured since this is where I do a lot of my own ramblings about what is seemingly my life, I will talk a bit about my weekend.

All things considered it went really well. Back into the work out full swing, this from what others have told me is doing wonders for me. I think the best one that I heard in regards to a lot of my physical change was "You have really matured and it looks good one you", or something along those lines.

Past that and of course some of the little household chores that help keep the place clean and stocked with food, I started up my stream again. Nothing to serious just something to do in the evenings before clocking out for the night. So far it has been really fun and a huge thanks to all of the people who has stopped out and watched me get scared as well as wrecked in Bloodborne.

But the reason I started that stream up was not so that I could just play games in front of an audience. But as a way of generating money to give to a charity. I am in a really good place in life, and I honestly do not need much to be happy, so I am able to live comfortably with my current job. This stream will just serve as a nice project of 3-4 hours a night gaming and if any type of donations come in, goes to a charity.

What I plan to do regardless of if I get donations or not, is to donate about one-hundred a month to a charity.

The only problem here is that I do not know of any charities at all or have done much research into it. If you my readers are in the know of any charities please share and I will look into them.

So anyways, yeah! Streaming will be a bit of a thing going forward. At least for about a month, to see how it goes or if it affects my sleep (read: four hours a night) schedule.

Other then all that fun, I continued to work through the Mistborn series that I have been reading. Man, this has so many twists and turns, but is such a great read. Also deceptively long, by that I mean it seems like it would be a short book but it really is not. This is always a good thing for a good book!

And it dawns on me that in two weeks I am throwing myself out of a plane. Why did I sign up for sky diving again?

Alright everyone, have a wonderful day.
