Morning everyone! Middle of the week so not much more to go. Soon the weekend will be right in front and we will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities it brings with it. However, focusing on today, I have my tea and a cliff bar, a bit of work to get through and some great plans for later. Although the day just doesn't feel right unless I start it off by creating a post. 

Today is going to be a simple posting. I am as the title states, on an adventure and like all great adventures, they can not go with out some up's and down's. Right now, the journey is a pretty good spot, a lull period, where I am just working on bettering myself as well as stabilizing my life. 

Lots has happened this past year, and have been going through a majority of changes that affect the way that I look at not only myself and the goals I had set but what I want to do as well as who I want to be. Who I want others to see me as. 

All I know is that my story is far from over, and each day I am constantly working towards being the best that I can be to the goals that I have set.

I want to leave you with a video that I had seen. In my spare time, or if I get a moment to myself, I find that I really enjoy getting lost watching TED talks. Well here is one that I watched last night that I thought was particularly powerful.

Have a wonderful day.
