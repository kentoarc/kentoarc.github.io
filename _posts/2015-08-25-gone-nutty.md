Happy Tuesday! Or to some whom I work with second Monday. I don't see why all the hate for Tuesdays, or Mondays for that matter. Regardless, I started my day off right with a peanut butter and jelly...pop tart. Yeah, that is right, a pop tart. Mostly this was due to science and wanting to see if it tasted good.

The pop tart was alright.

Anyways on to my random thoughts of the day.

I watch a lot of TED talks. In fact I have one to share today at the end of this blog. However it was yesterday that I was watching a few that related to "Working Smarter". Really great playlist over at TED that I encourage everyone to check out. There were a lot of great talks that really resonated with me. Ones that went over meetings and managers, leadership, the formula of success just to hit the spectrum a bit.

One that stood out to me the most was a talk where the presenter asked "Where do you go to get work done?". Well? I bet you didn't answer the office. Because I did not nor did most other people in the world who he also asked that exact question. Lots of people said places such as kitchen, starbucks, basement, den, the deck, living room, the assortment was large and not one of them said or mentioned the office.

Which in itself is strange right? Thousands and thousands of dollars get spent to make a place where employees are able to get work done yet that is the last place someone wants to be. I think that has something to do with one the environment, and two the distractions that happen while working. 

I get a majority of my work done early in the morning, barely anyone in the office and when the distractions are hardly there. No crazy last minute meetings or managers breathing down my neck. Nice, quiet and further more distraction free. Now I want to go out and say that a vast majority of the time, which is like 99%, that everything runs smoothly here where I work. The only time I have ever felt that I was wasting my time was partaking in meetings that have little to no value or that was something that could have been E-mailed, IM'ed or what I prefer just stopping next to my desk and giving me an update. No real reason to pull me away for an hour for something that takes five to ten minutes to explain it in a quick one on one.

I do not know, maybe I am just weird.

But I want to end this post today with a question and a TED talk. 

Where do you get the most work done?
