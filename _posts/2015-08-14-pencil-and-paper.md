The weekend is upon us! So happy Friday!

Wow, not really sure why but I am excited this morning, and more awake then usual. Just have that extra skip to my step. Onwards to the small thought that popped up this morning.

As I was doing a small yoga routine this morning to help stretch myself out, I had two thoughts. One was my arms should not be this tight and sore two days after the workout. Need more bananas in my diet it seems, and there is nothing wrong with more fruit, and the farmers market is here today! Alright, not to get side tracked, the second thought was about education.

The education that I had been thinking about was not the traditional school learning, where you crack opens a book or takes a test. I was thinking more along the lines of education through experience. Participating in some form of workshop, getting that hands on experience. Doing something not for the sake of making money or because it is a job, but to gain some type of knowledge or skill or a better understanding of a craft.

It seems, from my perspective at least, that many individuals don't want to push themselves to learn. They are content with following the same routine day in and day out, not taking an opportunity to peruse a learning experience that would open up their world to a new hobby or possibly a new profession.

There are tons of resources out in the world ranging from classes at a community center to the online community with YouTube videos. So many different avenues to go down that really are their no reason not to!

Myself personally, I have signed up to take part in a blacksmithing and lock picking class at the local Idea Foundry, which I can not wait to start. I also signed up for a few online courses in graphic design and agile development so that I can work on a few certificates. Then there is the skydiving...but that is more just try it out.

The options are out there, and you are never too old to start learning something new. More of comment to the younger readers. Do not worry about working to earn right now, especially if you are in school, work to learn instead. 

The attitude you have towards may seem like such a small thing, but makes the world of difference. 

Have an absolute wonderful weekend!
