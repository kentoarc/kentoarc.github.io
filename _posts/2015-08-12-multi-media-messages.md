おはよう！

For those that can not read that, good morning! Fun fact for the day, is that drinking a PowerAde after brushing ones teeth, and is absolutely horrid. Ranking it up on the list with orange juice.

Anyways, I wanted to write up a bit about communication. I was thinking about how we talk with one another and how lots of the way we communicate has been lost over the past few years. What used to be the norm of face to face conversations has slowly faded away into the background, being replaced by text messages and Facebook interactions.

This raises some interesting problems. One issue I feel is that the authenticity of the conversation is lost. The passion of a topic could be lost in translation over a text message. Where as in person, you can see the animation and hear the voice pick up when excited. Another issue is the lack of human interaction. Again not being able to hear and see the excitement radiating from another person as they talk is something that is missing in a lot of our day to day interactions. I feel that so many people these days are missing out on the chance of making new friends because they would prefer not to put themselves into a position that they may embarrass themselves or are afraid of not being liked. 

Something else that comes to mind is that I have noticed that a person can text another all the time but then never make an effort to see them. I have been guilty of this a few times in my life, but this is more of a topic for another day.

All of these missed opportunities of making new friends! This is whole idea is one of the driving reasons behind myself wanting to meet someone new everyday. There are so many wonderful people in the world that all have something unique about themselves that I honestly can't wait to find out about.

I hope the rest of the day goes well.

さようなら
