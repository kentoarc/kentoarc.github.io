Good morning, crack opens the window and listens to the rain hit the pond out back. Don't have any of that? Whelp, just open a window instead, the fresh air is wonderful. 

It was one of those days, where the bed just felt way to good to get out of this morning. Light rain, wonderful breeze, the hum of a fan, cuddling a pillow, I was in bliss. Of course all great things come to an end and mine came with the rather obnoxious alarm of mine. 

Anyways, on to my random thought this morning. 

So I was sitting at the kitchen table eating a bowl of fruity pebbles, I was attempting to relieve my childhood, and it was delicious. The thought that sprang up into my head was about dreams and future plans. A vast majority of the time plans and goals do not just magically fall into a persons lap, and if it does you may want to approach it cautiously. A lot of the time you have to fight for something that you want, showing that you are the best for the job or even how much the ideal means to you. 

Honestly, don't know to much why that though had appeared in my head this morning, over a bowl of cereal no less. 

Sometimes you have to be loud, so that others know you are following a dream.

Talk to you guys tomorrow, have a wonderful day.
