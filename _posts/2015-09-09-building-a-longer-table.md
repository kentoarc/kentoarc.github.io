Good afternoon!

I hope that everyone had a lovely lunch, or breakfast...possibly dinner. I am not down with all the time zones, but hopefully you have eaten something today to keep the mind and body going strong. Alright we are in the middle of the week; the promise of a relaxing weekend (which I am really looking forward to) is right around the corner. 

Still working through the book, as well as getting into the swing of things with the stream as well as my work out plan. This only now occurs to me that I have not had a rest day in over a week. Ah well just got to keep going, my body has not yet screamed at me to stop so I must be alright as long as I keep eating healthy.

Today is going to be a short post, mostly because there is not too much I want to get heavy into detail with. But I do want to bring up a small yet large obstacle for some.

Take a chance and talk with others. Don't let little things get in the way of a friendship or a relationship. I know that there are a lot of talks and points that cater towards how good communication is for a relationship, and I will not deny that fact. More so, I want to bring to light just how much it helps in friendships. Be those friendships of ex-lovers all the way to new found friends; don't block them off with a wall. Sure, there are some life events you just do not speak with in that company but there are numerous things to be gained from just hanging out with someone different or ranting and raving about the way that font looks.

There is a great many things that can be gained from opening up you a little bit to change. It is not at all bad. Of course take it in moderation, but still take some light steps towards it with that goal in mind.

That is where the title of this post comes from. I feel it sums a lot of this up really well and I just took it in the way of connections.

Build a longer table, not a fence.

See you tomorrow.
