###Monday morning rain is falling~

Alright so that sounded a bit more sing song in my head. I digress. Good morning though, start of a new week with tons of possibilities.  So even if the week starts out a little bit on the wet side, due to some rolling storms, do not let that dampen the mood.

> "My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor and some style." -Maya Angelo

I am currently still working on the style part, but I feel like this quote does a fairly good job of summing up one of my core beliefs. We as people go day to day, mostly going through the motions just to get by. A person wakes up, stumbles around, eats, heads to work and deals with traffic, works, comes home and eats, finally coming to a rest and repeating the process the next day. Alright well I generalized that...a lot. But the point I am aiming for is that most people go about the day to day life just to survive. They work in a job that they do not particularly enjoy so that they can pay bills, put food on the table, and other responsibilities that come with being an adult today.

Now, don't get me wrong, there is nothing at all wrong with having a position at a company that allows you to fulfill those responsibilities to family as well as society. However, I believe that is pure survival. Going back to the quote above, specifically the thriving portion. Do not feel unenthusiastic about working in a position that is not particularly interesting. Being able to thrive is something more, taking what you have and making the most of not only the life that you have control of, but the others that are around you. Taking up hobbies and going at them with renewed vigor, helping others through tough times, just being a pillar that one can use to lean on for a time. All of these instances that encompass passion and compassion will not only bring a new out look to ones life, but also bring a shift in perspectives.

I feel that there is a certain amount of the population that does and follows these principles. At least to some extent the intentions are pure and not driven by some form of self purpose. 

One of the best instances that I can give an example of is when I meet someone new and they share with me some of their life story. When someone speaks to you passionately abut a subject, you feel it, it gets you so inspired and curious that next you know, Google is open and you are searching about exactly what they had been talking about. Conversations like that always stick out to me, especially when I talk with strangers. Just the other day, I had a conversation with a young girl named Courtney who described to me in amazing and passionate detail her favorite flower and why. I went back to the office and was searching up and reading about a lot of the information that she had already told me, learning and being amazed at what the world of flowers has to offer me.

Reaching out and being compassionate to others opens a door to not only enhance ones own knowledge of the world around themselves, but to also allow them to look at it in a new light. Even if it is a little rainy outside.

See you guys tomorrow.
