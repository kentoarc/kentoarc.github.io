Morning readers, 

When looking outside the window, and taking in the view, everyone has a different perspective on what they are seeing. We can always choose to perceive things differently. We can focus on what's wrong in our life, or we can focus on what's right. Take a walk and change the environment, then reflect. Sometimes a simple walk down the city block is enough of a change to bring new light to a decision.

Enjoy the day, and enjoy the weekend.
