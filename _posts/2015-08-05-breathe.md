Good morning, and happy...err...Wednesday.

Kind of forgot the day, it has been a rough morning so far. Need more tea in my life.

So I wanted to do a quick post this morning, and it relates to the title. I want to talk about breathing, well, more about what breathing can help with. 

Breathing can help with an enormous amount of problems that may come up as you go about day to day. Other than the obvious, breathing to stay alive, but breathing can be an amazing form of stress relief.

So if you are stressing out about life, school, work, just take a moment, take a deep breathe, hold it in for a few seconds, then release. Do so as many times as needed. Clearing your mind and taking the moment can help give you that moment of clarity that will allow you to formulate a response to a debate, or figure out a situation that you have found yourself in.

That is it for me today, see you all tomorrow.
