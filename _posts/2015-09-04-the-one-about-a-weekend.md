Good afternoon!

Hope that the day has been a lovely one so far and that the morning was relaxed. I can easily say that mine was, albeit five days with out working out and then jumping back into it...that was kind of rough this morning. Past that though, I am currently writing this post up as a nerf gun war is breaking out in my office.

Have I mentioned how much I enjoy this job?

Well this weekend is a holiday, so hopefully everyone has some fun things planned! I am to finish up a book series that I have been reading (Mistborn) and to get a little bit further in Monster Hunter. I can't really place why, but I have been enjoying mobile gaming a lot more to the traditional sitting at a computer. 

I think it mostly comes from the mindset that I set all day at a desk that I don't want be going home to do the exact same thing for another few hours. 

I had discussed at one point, or maybe I had just thought it, but I did plan to start streaming again. Still totally in the works and a thought that I am having right now is just the best type of schedule as well as my whole brand. Not to mention platform and everything else under the umbrella that is streaming.

Hope everyone has a great weekend. Talk with you next week.
