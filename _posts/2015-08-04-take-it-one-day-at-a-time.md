Happy Tuesday, or to some the second Monday.

I had been thinking about more what I had written up yesterday. Just developing that thought a bit more and I thought looking at the other side and talking about depression, shyness, anxiety would help bring it to a much more fleshed out state.

This world is full of people who attempt everyday to challenge themselves or to help others overcome a problem that they may be facing. I like to believe that I am one of those people who go above and beyond to help someone find a job, find clients for their start-up, lend an ear when they need to speak, and encouragement about decisions that have been made. Myself, and many others share the same satisfaction of being able to step in and provide a helping hand.

However it is not all sunshine and rainbows. I have come to terms with a lot of events that have happened to me in the past. Realizing that I enjoy helping people not just for that small genuine feeling of doing a good deed or earning that pat on the back. Those are by products and take away from the actual message that I think is over looked. 

I believe that the saddest people always try their hardest to make others happy because they know what it's like to feel worthless and not wanted, and they do not want anyone else to feel like that.

Sitting down and really thinking about a lot of the interactions I have had in the past, the above statement holds true. I had reached out not only to distract myself from my own worries but to also help others avoid the same mistakes that I had made to lead to the position that I had been in currently. When people reach out and offer to help pick you up off your feet, or a friendly bit of advice, remember that we are all human and we all experience life in different ways growing our experience in how we interact and push forward with ourselves retaining the knowledge that we have gained.

Everyone is battling a war inside, some are small and others are on a much more massive scale. Try to keep the thought of that in mind when you see someone reaching out to help.

See you tomorrow.
