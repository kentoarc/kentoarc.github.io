Morning and what a wonderful Wednesday.

Today is going to be short and sweet. Well shorter than most I suppose.

So as I have mentioned before, I am flying out to Seattle for PAX Prime. Great convention that is all about video games and the communities surrounding them. So first and for most I will not be posting the rest of this week as well as a few days next week. Mostly due to traveling and not having the time to sit down and fully write something up. However there will be a decent write up when I get back.

As to what I want to mention today, is in relation to PAX. I have said before that I have mostly drifted away from game development and the gaming industry. Just not who I really am anymore. I enjoy the quick games where I do not have to sit down at a desk and commit a few hours into said game. To keep the topic on hand and not going into the reasons underneath, I did not make the choices I have to date, only to turn around and throw all of the hard work that I have done away.

This to me, not only will be a great experience for me to meet new people which I do so much enjoy, but also allows me to test myself and help put into perspective the choices that I have made. Not just that though, but it will also allow me to refine and strengthen those choices.

I like who I am now and who I am becoming, it is going to be simply interesting looking and participating at PAX with a new perspective on the event as a whole.

Have a wonderful week, and I promise that my next post will be a lengthy one. 

Safe travels.
