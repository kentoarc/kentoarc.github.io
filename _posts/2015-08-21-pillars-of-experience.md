It is Friday! The weekend is here! Dance, celebrate, do a handstand! 

Good morning, if you couldn't tell, I am a slight bit excited. Why? I will get to that in a bit. Before all of that I just want to take a moment to wish everyone a great weekend. Now on to the thoughts.

Last night I was having a conversation that involved regret over past decisions, or the experiences that had been gained by them. When looking back at one-self and just reflecting it is extremely easy to get caught up in the thought process and lose track of the progress you have made or the changes you have worked towards to make your life better.

It is easy to fall back into old habits or old thought patterns. That one rest day from working out could easily turn into two. That one slice of cake can become two. You see what I am getting at here. It is easy to get lost in the past, amongst all the self reflection. Remember to also look at how far you have come, all the experiences that you have gained from the events in your life. 

Everything that you have done will help with future decisions as well as adventures. Unless you decided it was a good idea to jump out of a plane like I did. Yeah, still trying to figure that one out myself, since the whole deathly afraid of heights plays into effect here.

So this ties in a bit too why I am excited. 

So next week on Thursday I will be flying to Seattle for about a week to help out at the PAX Prime convention. It is all things video games, chance to make new friends while hanging out with the old, and traveling but also something that I think to me is even more important then those.

Going to PAX is going to in a way test me and the decisions I have made since last year. I am not at all interested in working in the gaming industry like I once used to be. Not even that much into gaming, more all about the traveling, the books, and nature. Going to this convention is going to put the "new" me into a position where it will test my new ideals. 

I of course am going to try to make as many friends as I can, talk with others, network, dance (I am going to a salsa dance on Thursday night!) of course doing all that I can to make it enjoyable for myself as well as others.

But I want to prove to myself that all the things I have been saying are not just words. That I am truly not interested in that path anymore, and to add an extra layer of stability to my decision.

I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend! I will be talking more about PAX next week. Still need to pack.

Talk to you guys later.
