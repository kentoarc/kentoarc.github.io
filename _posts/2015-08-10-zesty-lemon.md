Good morning and what a fine Monday morning it is. I hope that everyone had a wonderful weekend and has some stories to share or memories that were made.

I enjoyed the weekend. Grabbed myself a book, listened to some music, and ate some tasty food. I still have not finished the book; however I am hoping to finish it at lunch today. The book in question is called "Mistborn" by Brandon Sanderson. If fantasy is a genre you find enjoyable, by all means give this book a try.

A thought that I had over the weekend was about relationships and the past. I do not just mean relationships that only existed as a boyfriend or a girlfriend, but also family and friends. Looking back and I would say that most have had similar experiences, that at one point or another you did not get along with a person who was close to you. A tiny issue or a full blown argument, regardless of what the problem was it happened.

Those situations and circumstances sometimes lead to a falling out between the two parties. That in itself is sad realization, knowing that a part of you has been cut out of your life. 

You don't stop loving someone just because they hurt you. It would certainly make things easier if you did.

Have a wonderful Monday, stay positive and I will talk to you guys soon.
