Good morning and happy Monday readers.

Hope that everyone had an eventful weekend, filled with relaxation and time well spent. I know that I did, I even got a little competitive while racing around a track.

I suppose I should explain. 

So this weekend was filled with tons of fun activities, Friday I went and seen the Scorch Trials, which was a good movie for what it was but it pulled a bit away from the book and that alone made me sad since the first one I thought did a really good job of it.

Saturday, was a day that was filled with go-karting and shopping. First off, those go-karts can really go and another point is some people should not be allowed behind the wheel of one of those. However my best lap time was 38.9 seconds. I think that is pretty good for not ever have done that before. As for shopping, the adventure took us to a place called Tensuke Market which is a Japanese market place that has imports from Japan. What that means is I spent lots of money on baked goods and snacks. I regret nothing at all. Would do it again in a heartbeat.

Wrapping up the fun weekend on Sunday, was Rock Climbing. Great work out for sure and well being afraid of heights does make it a bit difficult at times for sure, but I completed 4 out of the 5 climbs that I did! The reason for the first was mostly I got stuck in a spot and then looked down causing my arms to lock up. Key tip, don't look down.

Hope that everyone has a fantastic week!

Talk to you tomorrow.
