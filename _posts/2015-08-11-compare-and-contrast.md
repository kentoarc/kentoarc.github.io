Good morning, what a wonderful Tuesday it has already started out to be!

Before I begin with what I was thinking about this morning, I wanted to say thank you for reading my small ramblings as you enjoy the morning, I hope that something I say may spark a thought or realization and let you see life in a different way.

This is a perfect way to start the post, and the topic that came to mind this morning.

###Life is so ironic.

On my way into work today, I was struck by an interesting idea. Driven mostly by a bit of my past, I had been rolling around with the idea that is bolded above. Let me lay out what I had thought of a bit this morning as I looked out of my office window. 

It takes sadness to know happiness, noise to appreciate silence, absence to value presence, misery to treasure contentment, loss to appreciate gain, and turmoil to honor peace.

My understanding and I suppose realization as I am writing this is rather simple. That is life and unless you compare one aspect to another, then it will be hard to truly embrace.

Have a wonderful morning, see you all tomorrow.
