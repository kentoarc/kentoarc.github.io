Morning! A wonderful fog was lazily drifting over the pond this morning was nice, relaxing start to the day. Not to mention, I have had an urge to just dig my toes into some sand. I should make it to a beach here in the next few weeks, especially with winter right around the corner.

The only thing I have been thinking about is old habits of mine that were not the greatest and doing my best to make sure I don't fall back into them. It is so easy to just come home from work, lie down and do nothing but watch Netflix the rest of the night. As much as I want to do that, completing these online courses I have signed up for as well as doing a bit of research actual feels better. In a more psychological way, at least. Going to the gym everyday (unless it rains, boo!), eating healthy foods, all of this is slowly forming great habits and when I don't do any of these things, specially when it comes to working out I feel so horrible, slow.

We all have some combination of good habits and bad. They are one of the many factors that define us and who we are. It does not hurt to address the bad habits, trying to turn them into good ones. A big one for me is being honest with myself and those I love. Keeping everything bottled up is never a healthy way to live and can cause a great deal of problems in all aspects of life.

I hope that you all enjoy your day; I am going to eat this here blueberry crisp granola bar I had attempted to make. 

See you guys tomorrow.
