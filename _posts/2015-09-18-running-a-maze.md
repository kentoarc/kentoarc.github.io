Happy Friday everyone!

Got some big plans this weekend? If not make some! I am doing tons of things this weekend and I will make sure to be on top of the camera duties so that I can look back and all of that fun jazz.

Well you may be wondering what all I have planned. Well let us break it down a bit.

Going to a Studio Movie grill, and see the new MazeRunner movie (hence the title of this post), Go-karting, going to play with some kittens, and a japanese market place!

Maybe a splash of rock climbing in there.

Hope everyone has a fantastic weekend.
