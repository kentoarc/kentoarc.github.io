Yarr harr! The pirate life for me!

Good morning, and happy Monday. Hope that the weekend went well and was eventful for all of my fine readers. Mine was relaxing. Splash of working out, some online classes, a book and cooked all of the food needed for my lunches this week. I also had every pirate theme song stuck in my head, bouncing around for really no reason. 

It works for what I wanted to talk about today. Being carefree and taking lifeâ€™s events in stride. Pirates, at least the ones that Hollywood has glamour us with, show this carefree nature. Alright, enough with pirates.

I talked about stress a few weeks ago, and this topic does kind of touch back to what I had been saying then. It is alright to have a little bit of stress in your life and to use it as a motivator. Knowing when to say "hell with it" and just let the events play out is another way to look at life. 

There are moments in our lives that we have no control over. We can work hard towards a promotion but in the end it is someone else who decides if we get it or not. We can not force them to give it to us thinking that we are entitled simply because we worked hard. There should of course be some type of pay off for hard work that comes in the form of success and knowledge. This outlook applies a lot in the professional world, at least from what I have seen and been apart of. This thought can also be applied to someoneâ€™s personal life as well. Simply put, you can not force a person to love you.

There are a lot of actions we can take into our own hands, some leading into peace of mind or a successful life. I am going to end this with a quote I seen this morning.

> "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen."

Have a wonderful day!
