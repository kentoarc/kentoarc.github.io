Happy Friday!

Let's jump right into the idea that was bouncing around my head this morning. 

###Change.

Change is a constant and a part of everyoneâ€™s lives both professionally and personally. When you sit back and look at the uncertainty of change, the result shows that many people in all walks of life have different reactions and responses to the change taking place. One of the major keys to a positive change is to provide healthy, balanced and constructive feedback to these people so that they are given the opportunity to see what's possible in transforming their actions into something healthier/better.

I bring the topic of change up because I feel that, everyday I am pushing myself to create situations that enable positive change to happen. Not only for myself, but also for those that are around me, my team here at work, family, and close friends. Extending all the way to the random strangers that I meet each day by just reaching out and extending a hand of friendship and curiosity.

That leads me to speak about an individual that I had the pleasure of speaking with. 

As I was dining on some of the delicious eateries in the area of where I work, I happened across a man named Ramesh. Our interaction was not as long winded as my previous write up for a one a day. We shared all but 45 seconds as we waited for the cross walk to flip. In those 45 seconds, I had asked what he thought about change, so we spoke about change on a professional level, driving the point home that leaders and managers have the potential to cultivate the positive change to improve the work place in almost all aspects. Great guy, and has some solid idea when it comes to change. I hope he enjoyed his chipotle, because it did smell pretty good.

There is much we can say about both sides of change.

Truth is, at the end of the day, you can't change someone who doesn't see an issue within their actions.
