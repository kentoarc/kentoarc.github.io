Happy Wednesday!

Sorry for the lack of a posting yesterday. Work got crazy busy all of a sudden with our itteration coming to a close so we are trying to make sure that everything is getting done and completed on time! 

Hopefully everyone is having a great week. Try to get outside and enjoy the nice weather! I know that I will be, currently getting ready to go to a park with the rest of my team and we will be doing all sorts of activities.

Like sack races.

I am avoiding that though and I will be finding a nice tree to sit under.

Have a wonderful day everyone.
