Good morning and happy Monday! 

Had a wonderful storm come through last night, the rain, the thunder, it all sounded quite wonderful. At least until the rain started getting into my room by the window. I tried to keep it open so that I could still listen but ultimately had to close it all the way. 

Other then getting rained on a tad bit, I also fought off a fever this weekend. Kind of put a few kinks in the plans that I had made but the extra rest was really nice. Plus it let me finish the second Mistborn book, and let me start on the third. 

Well that was my weekend, hope yours was as exciting.

As to what I want to talk about today is in the title of this post. Learning. At least the dedication to taking the time and learn and to better oneself. Learning does not need to be painful; in fact if it is then I am almost positive that you are doing something horribly wrong. Granted this is a fine line to walk, since some cases such as school and college you are required to partake in studies that may not follow along the degree path you have chosen yet when learning new exciting subjects, it should not be a chore to learn.

In fact, do the shotgun approach and try out as many different opportunities as possible! Sign up for classes; watch YouTube videos, read articles. You never know if it is something that you may like till you try it out (Heck I say that about food all of the time).

As soon as you find something you enjoy learning about continue learning about that subject! This is the most important part; don't just do a few classes for what ever it ends up being and then stopping. Find a way to work it into your daily routine. Enjoy kayaking? Sure you may not be able to get out on a river everyday but you can do exercises that will strengthen your muscles so that when you get out on the river that weekend. There are plenty of ways that you can include your studies into a daily routine; sometimes you need to be creative.

I kind of feel that I was a bit all over the place with this post. Which I suppose was true, my head is still a little muddy from whatever it was that I was dealing with all weekend long.

Have a wonderful Monday.
