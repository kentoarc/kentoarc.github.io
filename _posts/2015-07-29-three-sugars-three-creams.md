Smell that? Most likely not, but if you could it would be the roasted smell of fresh coffee as the sun comes up. An absolute pleasure to wake up in the morning to. Maybe you are not much of a coffee person, and that is fine! You can get the same sensation with tea or even hot chocolate, the latter being a wonderful choice for the winter months.
So what makes coffee such an amazing morning ritual. Other than it being to some a necessity before even getting the day started, every morning, it can also be used as a great meeting place for friends and family. It works particularly well for me when I am looking to meet someone new. What better place to introduce yourself than in line at Starbucks. Try to reach out next time you are in line getting that mocha frappacino and learn about someone else story.

I am not going to talk all about coffee though. We all have our own little morning rituals that we go through when we finally roll out of bed for the day. I listen to soft music, or even something a bit on the stronger side of blues and jazz. Really helps wake me up in the morning, of course not everyone does something like music. Others I have talked with like to start the day reading the newspaper, illustrating letters, and even working out. A mixture of a few activates or just one, these little rituals that we do every morning are something I think help define us and who we are. Studies have shown that those that are active in the morning and get an early start do get a lot more down and feel over all more productive. I have been waking up early for awhile now and I can say that, the claim that the study makes, is pretty spot on.

So no matter what the morning ritual is for you, keep it up. Watch that sunrise over a steaming cup of coffee or tea. Read a few chapters in that book that has your mind so captivated. Go for a run with the dog and get a nice cardio work out in while the brisk morning air is still hanging around.

So I would like to end the post this morning with a question.
