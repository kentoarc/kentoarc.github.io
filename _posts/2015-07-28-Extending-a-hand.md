Hey everyone, today I figured I would talk about some of my new year’s resolutions. Well a few is not a fair amount, since I only ever made one resolution.

>"Meet someone new every single day."

My goal that I had in mind when I came up with the resolution was that, in or day to day lives we walk by so many different individuals who all have a different story. Some are willing to share those willingly; others take a simple handshake or greeting before they will talk. So I took this idea I had, or I guess rather a thought process, and applied it to the New Year’s resolution and came up with the above.

What does this all mean and why am I even bothering writing it out? Whelp.  I want to share with you some of the stories of the people that I have introduced myself too. My plan going forward is to have a post like this every couple days, just going over who I met.

So since I am not about to do every single person I have met up until this point, I will start with the person from today.

I packed lunch today, well had left over’s, so when the time to grab my grub and head down stairs to eat I was absolutely ready to tear into the food. When I got down to the second floor lobby to sit down and eat, I decided that I would take the time to get to know another person over lunch. So I looked around the room, found a person and politely asked if they were busy. Enter Daniel. Daniel works on the floor a few below mine and has been with the company for a few years now. However, an absolutely brilliant person to speak with over some lunch and would gladly do it again. 

On of the big buzzwords coming up these days is Neural Networks, and the majority of our conversation was about exactly that. Spent a good half hour talking over lunch about technology, music and restaurants in the area that he had personally liked and thought that I would like it as well.

Was a wonderful lunch experience, and I would not have known about this mom and pop restaurant that I am going to on Thursday if I never took the opportunity to sit down and speak with Daniel.

Can not wait to see what tomorrow brings.
