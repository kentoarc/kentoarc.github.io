Thursday is here, which means tomorrow is Friday!

One more day everyone then it will be the weekend. So keep that music going and keep on pushing through. Speaking of music I have been listening to the global hits on Spotify, some pretty interesting music for sure that is being listened to people all over the world.

Let's me branch out a bit. Which is always a great idea every once in a while. Plus I have already found like five new songs to add to my work-out playlist. That alone is a huge win for me.

As for the work picnic yesterday, it was a lot of fun! Specially the food from the food trucks. Had a taco bowl from one and goodness. So much better then Chipotle yet it still does not quite measure up to Taco King. Man, Taco King is so wonderful and I have not had it in what feels like years.

I also got all the audio equipment in the mail yesterday! Brand new microphone as well as some headphones. It sounds so smooth, and I can't wait to test it out this weekend. Only waiting that long because I am getting a desk in the mail as well, tomorrow I think, so I can set everything up.

May even get back into recording some of the songs I have written or back to playing covers of my favorite songs on my acoustic guitar.

That is all from me today, see you all tomorrow.
