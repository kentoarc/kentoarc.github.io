Morning my dear readers. 

I hope that today is a quick one at work so that you may all get to the weekend and enjoy it. I know that I will be, specially since there is a lot of really great things just happening in general.

I have been working towards making some nice changes in my life to lead a much healthier life style, and I have started to notice a lot of them start to take shape. From eating fresh fruit and veggies, preparing my own meals, hitting the gym every single day (other then my rest days), my body is feeling great. Of course looking at my refelction so when looking for changes it is hard to notice them, but going back and looking at pictures from when I was in Seattle to the previous pictures that have been on my Facebook. I can see the change in my physical appearnce from just working out alone. 

It is a pretty great feeling.

Sure there are some signs like actually seeing a six-pack that is a pretty good pointer to muscle mass. 

Just the over all feeling of getting in shape, as well as being physical fit is almost like a drug. I used to be impartial about cardio, not wanting to run unless I was required to. Now I can't wait for cardio days and I find myself trying to push myself further and further every time.

For anyone has ever been on the fence about working out, let me give you some advice.

JUST DO IT!

Alright the moment has passed let me really say what I wanted to say. Don't get into working out just to "lose weight" or "get abs", try to find an element that is enjoyable and capitalize on it.

This may be a tad bit strange coming from me since I have said before that you should use goals and stres to help you get closer to the goals that have been set. But I find that with working out, at least in my experince that a general plan is better then a strict work out regime.

The feeling after working out is a wonderful bliss that I wish was easy to share.

Hopefully everyone has some amazing plans this weekend. Keep positive and keep up all the hardwork. It will all pay off soon.

See you later.
