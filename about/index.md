Let's sit down a moment and relax. Take a look around and observe our surrondings. Does any of it feel familiar? Is it new?

What this whole site is about is just my take on the crazy situations that I find myself in and what I am able to make of them. Be the stories come from the random people I talk with everyday, to some history that is relevant to the change that is happening in the present moment.

I am sure that just like this site's title that everything in this about me may change over time. I am perfectly okay with that because that just means more stories and adventures I get to share with everyone from my little corner here on the internet.
